# Reproducible-Research
Course project #1 for Coursera Data Science specialization / Johns Hopkins, course #5

*My comments*:
A very challenging assignment I found, particularly in getting the grouping and summarizing
of the dataset to work properly. I intend to finish all portions of this assignment (even after the 
the project deadline if need be) but in the interim, I have posted my work in progress at least so
there will be a record of my progress thus far.
Thanks, Jim
